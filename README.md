# ðŸ“° News Sentiment Trading Bot

This project implements and analyzes a trading strategy driven by financial news sentiment. It fetches news articles for specified companies, scores their sentiment using VADER, generates daily buy/sell/hold signals, and backtests these signals against historical stock price data from Yahoo Finance. The results, including cumulative returns and comparisons to a buy-and-hold strategy, are visualized in an interactive Streamlit dashboard.

# Timeline


## Project Setup + Data Ingestion

- âœ… Created folder structure (`src/`, `data/`, `app.py`)
- âœ… Set up `config.py` to safely store NewsAPI key
- âœ… Wrote initial `fetch_news()` using NewsAPI
- âœ… Enabled multi-ticker support (Apple, Tesla, Microsoft, Amazon)
- âœ… Appended all articles to `data/news.csv`
- âœ… Added `company` and `sentiment` fields for each row

## Sentiment Analysis + Visualization

- âœ… Used VADER to score each headline (`compound` score only)
- âœ… Appended sentiment values to `news.csv`
- âœ… Created `generate_signals()` to label each day:
  - `buy` if sentiment > 0.2
  - `sell` if sentiment < -0.2
  - `hold` otherwise
- âœ… Built bar chart for average sentiment per company
- âœ… Added `src/tickers.py` to modularize company-to-ticker mapping

## Signal-Price Merging + Simulation

- âœ… Wrote `fetch_price_data()` using `yfinance`
- âœ… Merged sentiment signals with price data on matching dates
- âœ… Calculated next-day returns
- âœ… Simulated returns for:
  - Buy â†’ gain if price rises
  - Sell â†’ gain if price falls
  - Hold â†’ no trade
- âœ… Tracked cumulative return over time
- âœ… Plotted company-wise and portfolio-wise strategy performance
- âœ… Added buy/sell markers to plots

## Strategy Evaluation + Automation Plan

- âœ… Compared sentiment strategy to buy-and-hold returns
- âœ… Logged best and worst daily returns
- âœ… Set up `daily_fetch.py` for automated news pulling
- âœ… Scheduled it using **Windows Task Scheduler**
- âœ… Finalized full pipeline with:
  - Sentiment scoring
  - Signal generation
  - Price merging
  - Simulation
  - Visualization

## Streamlit Development & Refinement (Ongoing)

- âœ… Enhanced app.py (Streamlit Dashboard):
  - âœ… Integrated data_pipeline.py and strategy.py to run the full workflow from the UI.
  - âœ… Display of cumulative return plots (individual and portfolio) using matplotlib via st.pyplot().
  - âœ… Tabular display of detailed strategy results and performance summaries.
  - âœ… Visualization of raw news data and sentiment trends (average sentiment per company, daily sentiment trend for selected company).
  - âœ… Implemented robust data handling to prevent stale data issues across multiple runs/selections by clearing and reloading data specific to user inputs.
  - âœ… Added debug outputs and error handling for a better user experience.
- âœ… Refined import paths and project structure for better modularity (e.g., src as a package).
- âœ… Addressed and fixed bugs related to data consistency, merging, and Streamlit caching.
